## Objectives

## Instructions
In this project, you are to implement a static website for a personal or professional purpose. The process and deliverables for this project will be phased as follows ...

### Plan
Your website must exist for one or more practical purposes. First create a planning document which details the goals and objectives of your website. The planning document can be written in any format (I recommend markdown) and should contain the following sections:

1. Overiew - Describe the practical purpose that this site will address and some basic details of the site (such as number of pages, dynamic/static, responsive, etc.).
2. Goals - Describe the main goals of the site along with objectives that describe how the site will reach that goal.
3. Target Users - Describe several user personas that will utilize your site.
4. Content - Summarize the content of your site on a per-page basis as well as any non-page elements which deserve mention.
5. Similar Sites - Find several relevant sites for inspiration and detail them here.

Inlcude all the planning documents in your repository in a directory named `/plan'. Make sure to get instructor approval before moving onto design.

### Design
Design the look and feel of your webiste. The following artifacts should be included ...

* Wireframes for each page.
* Site map to illustrate navigation of site.
* Sample of main site colors and description of each.

You should organize these components into one design document and include the document and any images, etc. in your repository under a folder named `/design`. Make sure to get instructor approval before moving onto develop.

### Develop
Once you are satisfied and have received approval of your plan and design, it is time to implement the site. Continue development until you are satisfied that you have met your stated objectives and the requirements of the project. Ensure that you publish your site publicly.

## Requirements
Your final site should adhere to the following requirements ...

* Site must contain at least 4 HTML pages and at least 1 custom CSS file.
* Site must use Twitter Bootstrap for the majority of your base CSS, including using the grid for layout.
* You must utilize at least 5 Bootstrap components in your implementation.
* Utilize FontAwesome icons in your implementation.
* Design should be mobil-friendly and responsive.
* JavaScript may be utilized but is not required.

All documenation provided as part of the planning and design processes should be neat, professional and well thought out.
